    <p class="font1">Over the past few months, I've noticed a significant increase in the number of people visiting the
      herb shop or reaching out to me online,
      seeking guidance for the growing presence of stress and anxiety in their lives.<br />

      The symptoms they're commonly listing are:
    <ul class="font1">
      <li> Trouble focusing</li>
      <li> Racing thoughts</li>
      <li> Mood swings</li>
      <li> Feeling overwhelmed</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="font1">These symptoms can really put a damper on different areas of life, from work to relationships and
      mental well-being. If left unchecked, they can cause a whole bunch of other troubles like digestive problems and
      high blood pressure. Yikes! That's why it's crucial to tackle them head-on to prevent any potential issues later
      on.

      Here are a few herbs that I often recommend based on their effectiveness in addressing stress and anxiety levels.
    </p>
    <p class="font1">

            <ol class="font1">
              <li><h3 >Low-Stress Levels:</h3>
                <span class="highlight"> Chamomile</span> tea has been shown to calm the nerves. It is relaxing and also helps ease and soothe a nervous, upset
                stomach and tense muscles.</li><br/>
              <li><h3>Medium-Stress Levels:</h3>
                <span class="highlight">  Passionflower</span> is indicated for people who have "monkey mind." They can't stop thinking, and their brain is
                constantly going in all directions. It can help to relieve nervousness, anxiety, and panic and help to restore
                an overall sense of well-being. It can also help induce and improve the quality of sleep.</li><br/>
              <li><h3>High-Stress Levels:</h3>
                <span class="highlight"> Kava,</span> a remarkable herbal remedy for acute anxiety, offers fast-acting effects to help alleviate immediate
                states of anxiety, like panic attacks. Consider using it as a tincture in drop doses for optimal results.</li>
            </ol>

      <h1>A Delicious Stress & Anxiety Elixir!</h1>
    </p>
    <p class="font1 ">
      This recipe is made from a go-to herb for stress and mild depression that might even be growing in your garden… Lemon Balm! My<span class="highlight">Lemon Balm Honey Brandy Elixir Recipe</span>  is delightful! It’s not only delicious, but, it also helps to uplift the spirit and calm the mind. 

You can enjoy it over ice, mix into drinks, or even drizzle over ice cream. It's a fun and tasty way to reap the benefits of this amazing herb<br/>
</p>

<p class="font1"><span class="highlight">Lemon balm:</span> Has been used for centuries to reduce stress and anxiety by working with chemicals in the brain that promote calmness and improved mood. It enhances the activity of a chemical called GABA, which has a calming effect on the brain. Lemon balm also helps maintain healthy levels of serotonin, a chemical that affects mood, and this can contribute to reducing anxiety.
 Additionally, lemon balm helps regulate stress hormones like cortisol and has antioxidants that protect against damage caused by stress and anxiety.
